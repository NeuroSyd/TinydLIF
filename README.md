This study presents a novel approach to seizure detection by leveraging the unique capabilities of Dendritic LIF models. By applying these models to both EEG and ECoG datasets, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of seizure detection algorithms. Our research harnesses the heterogeneity inherent in Dendritic LIF models to better capture the nuanced dynamics of epileptic activity, paving the way for more effective diagnostic tools and treatments in epilepsy management.
